abstract = {In this paper we examine robustness of a recently developed panel data stochastic frontier model that allows for both persistent and transient (also known as long-run and short-run or time-invariant and time-varying) inefficiency along with random firm-effects (heterogeneity) and noise. We address some concerns that the practitioners might have about this model. First, given that there are two random time-invariant components (persistent inefficiency and firm-effects) the concern is whether the model can accurately identify them, and if so how precisely can the model estimate them? Second, there are two time-varying random components (transient inefficiency and noise), and the concern is whether the model can separate noise from transient inefficiency, and if so how precisely can the model estimate transient inefficiency? Third, how well are persistent and transient inefficiency estimated under different scenarios, viz., under different configurations of the variance parameters of the four random components? Given that the model is quite complex, relatively new and becoming quite popular in the panel efficiency literature, we feel that there is need for a detailed simulation study to examine when, where and how one can use this model with confidence to estimate persistent and transient inefficiency.},

abstract = {Longitudinal studies, where data are repeatedly collected on subjects over a period, are common in medical research. When estimating the effect of a time-varying treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest measured at a later time, standard methods fail to give consistent estimators in the presence of time-varying confounders if those confounders are themselves affected by the treatment. Robins and colleagues have proposed several alternative methods that, provided certain assumptions hold, avoid the problems associated with standard approaches. They include the g-computation formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural nested models. In this tutorial, we give a description of each of these methods, exploring the links and differences between them and the reasons for choosing one over the others in different settings.},

abstract = {Estimating causal effects is a frequent goal of epi-demiologic studies. Traditionally, there have been three established systematic threats to consistent estimation of caus-al effects. These three threats are bias due to confounders, selection, and measurement error. Confounding, selection, and measurement bias have typically been characterized as distinct types of biases. However, each of these biases can also be characterized as missing data problems that can be ad-dressed with missing data solutions. Here we describe how the aforementioned systematic threats arise from missing data as well as review methods and their related assumptions for reducing each bias type. We also link the assumptions made by the reviewed methods to the missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR) assumptions made in the missing data framework that allow for valid inferences to be made based on the observed, incomplete data.},

@article{Robins1986,
abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Causal effects are comparisons among values that would have been observed under all possible assignments of treatments to experimental units. In an experiment, one assignment of treatments is chosen and only the values under that assignment can be observed. Bayesian inference for causal effects follows from finding the predictive distribution of the values under the other assignments of treatments. This perspective makes clear the role of mechanisms that sample experimental units, assign treatments and record data. Unless these mechanisms are ignorable (known probabi-listic functions of recorded values), the Bayesian must model them in the data analysis and, consequently, confront inferences for causal effects that are sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution of the data. More-over, not all ignorable mechanisms can yield data from which inferences for causal effects are insensitive to prior specifications. Classical random-ized designs stand out as especially appealing assignment mechanisms designed to make inference for causal effects straightforward by limiting the sensitivity of a valid Bayesian analysis.},

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue: Selected Papers from the 2010 Asia-Pacific Productivity Conference Estimation of technical efficiency is widely used in empirical research using both cross-sectional and panel data. Although several stochastic frontier models for panel data are available, only a few of them are normally applied in empirical research. In this article we chose a broad selection of such models based on different assumptions and specifications of heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity and technical inefficiency. We applied these models to a single dataset from Norwegian grain farmers for the period 2004-2008. We also introduced a new model that disentangles firm effects from persistent (time-invariant) and residual (time-varying) technical inefficiency. We found that efficiency results are quite sensitive to how inefficiency is modeled and interpreted. Consequently, we recommend that future empirical research should pay more attention to modeling and interpreting inefficiency as well as to the assumptions underlying each model when using panel data.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Greene2005,
abstract = {This paper examines several extensions of the stochastic frontier that account for unmeasured heterogeneity as well as firm inefficiency. The fixed effects model is extended to the stochastic frontier model using results that specifically employ its nonlinear specification. Based on Monte Carlo results, we find that the incidental parameters problem operates on the coefficient estimates in the fixed effects stochastic frontier model in ways that are somewhat at odds with other familiar results. We consider a special case of the random parameters model that produces a random effects model that preserves the central feature of the stochastic frontier model and accommodates heterogeneity. We then examine random parameters and latent class models. In these cases, explicit models for firm heterogeneity are built into the stochastic frontier. Comparisons with received results for these models are presented in an application to the U.S. banking industry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stochastic frontier models with autocorrelated inefficiency have been proposed in the past as a way of addressing the issue of temporal variation in firm-level efficiency scores. They are justified using an underlying model of dynamic firm behavior. In this paper we argue that these models could have radically different implications for the expected long-run efficiency scores in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The possibility of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is explored. Random- and correlated random-effects dynamic stochastic frontier models are proposed and applied to a panel of US electric utilities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We begin with a model where a Chamberlain-Mundlak device is used to relate a transformation of time-invariant effects to the regressors. This basic model is then extended in two directions: first an extra one-sided error term is added to allow for time-varying efficiencies. Second, a model with an equation for instrumental variables and a more general error covariance structure is introduced to accommodate correlations between both error terms and the regressors. An application of the first and second models to Philippines rice data is provided.},

@article{Amsler2016,
abstract = {Stochastic frontier models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood (MLE) or corrected ordinary least squares. The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency. In a standard regression setting, simultaneity is handled by a number of procedures that are numerically or asymptotically equivalent. These include 2SLS; using the residual from the reduced form equations for the endogenous variables as a control function; and MLE of the system that contains the equation of interest plus the unrestricted reduced form equations for the endogenous variables (LIML). We will consider modifications of these standard procedures for the stochastic frontier setting. The paper is mostly a survey and combination of existing results from the stochastic frontier literature and the classic simultaneous equations literature, but it also contains some new results.},
