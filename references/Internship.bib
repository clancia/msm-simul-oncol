abstract = {Stochastic frontier models with autocorrelated inefficiency have been proposed in the past as a way of addressing the issue of temporal variation in firm-level efficiency scores. They are justified using an underlying model of dynamic firm behavior. In this paper we argue that these models could have radically different implications for the expected long-run efficiency scores in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The possibility of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is explored. Random- and correlated random-effects dynamic stochastic frontier models are proposed and applied to a panel of US electric utilities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue: Selected Papers from the 2010 Asia-Pacific Productivity Conference Estimation of technical efficiency is widely used in empirical research using both cross-sectional and panel data. Although several stochastic frontier models for panel data are available, only a few of them are normally applied in empirical research. In this article we chose a broad selection of such models based on different assumptions and specifications of heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity and technical inefficiency. We applied these models to a single dataset from Norwegian grain farmers for the period 2004-2008. We also introduced a new model that disentangles firm effects from persistent (time-invariant) and residual (time-varying) technical inefficiency. We found that efficiency results are quite sensitive to how inefficiency is modeled and interpreted. Consequently, we recommend that future empirical research should pay more attention to modeling and interpreting inefficiency as well as to the assumptions underlying each model when using panel data.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Greene2005,
abstract = {This paper examines several extensions of the stochastic frontier that account for unmeasured heterogeneity as well as firm inefficiency. The fixed effects model is extended to the stochastic frontier model using results that specifically employ its nonlinear specification. Based on Monte Carlo results, we find that the incidental parameters problem operates on the coefficient estimates in the fixed effects stochastic frontier model in ways that are somewhat at odds with other familiar results. We consider a special case of the random parameters model that produces a random effects model that preserves the central feature of the stochastic frontier model and accommodates heterogeneity. We then examine random parameters and latent class models. In these cases, explicit models for firm heterogeneity are built into the stochastic frontier. Comparisons with received results for these models are presented in an application to the U.S. banking industry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Badunenko2016,
abstract = {In this paper we examine robustness of a recently developed panel data stochastic frontier model that allows for both persistent and transient (also known as long-run and short-run or time-invariant and time-varying) inefficiency along with random firm-effects (heterogeneity) and noise. We address some concerns that the practitioners might have about this model. First, given that there are two random time-invariant components (persistent inefficiency and firm-effects) the concern is whether the model can accurately identify them, and if so how precisely can the model estimate them? Second, there are two time-varying random components (transient inefficiency and noise), and the concern is whether the model can separate noise from transient inefficiency, and if so how precisely can the model estimate transient inefficiency? Third, how well are persistent and transient inefficiency estimated under different scenarios, viz., under different configurations of the variance parameters of the four random components? Given that the model is quite complex, relatively new and becoming quite popular in the panel efficiency literature, we feel that there is need for a detailed simulation study to examine when, where and how one can use this model with confidence to estimate persistent and transient inefficiency.},

We begin with a model where a Chamberlain-Mundlak device is used to relate a transformation of time-invariant effects to the regressors. This basic model is then extended in two directions: first an extra one-sided error term is added to allow for time-varying efficiencies. Second, a model with an equation for instrumental variables and a more general error covariance structure is introduced to accommodate correlations between both error terms and the regressors. An application of the first and second models to Philippines rice data is provided.},

@article{Amsler2016,
abstract = {Stochastic frontier models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood (MLE) or corrected ordinary least squares. The consistency of either estimator depends on exogeneity of the explanatory variables (inputs, in the production frontier setting). We will investigate the case that one or more of the inputs is endogenous, in the simultaneous equation sense of endogeneity. That is, we worry that there is correlation between the inputs and statistical noise or inefficiency. In a standard regression setting, simultaneity is handled by a number of procedures that are numerically or asymptotically equivalent. These include 2SLS; using the residual from the reduced form equations for the endogenous variables as a control function; and MLE of the system that contains the equation of interest plus the unrestricted reduced form equations for the endogenous variables (LIML). We will consider modifications of these standard procedures for the stochastic frontier setting. The paper is mostly a survey and combination of existing results from the stochastic frontier literature and the classic simultaneous equations literature, but it also contains some new results.},
