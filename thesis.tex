\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a popular class of models for
performing causal inference in the presence of time dependent
confounders. These models have an important application in areas of
research such as epidemiology, social sciences and economics where
randomised trials are prohibited by ethical or financial considerations,
and hence confounding cannot be ruled out by randomization. Under these
circumstances confounding can obscure the causal effect of treatment on
outcome. An example of this, common in epidemiological studies, occurs
when prognostic variables inform treatment decisions while at same time
being predictors of the outcome of interest. In a longitudinal setting
this is further complicated when the confounder itself is determined by
earlier treatment. One consequence is that regression adjustment methods
do not control for confounding in the longitudinal case and other
techniques are required. \linebreak

The Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimator is a
technique which leads to consistent estimates in the presence of has
been applied to censoring, missing data and survey design problems. The
central idea is that by weighting the observed data in order to create a
pseudo population is constructed in which treatemnt is assigned at
random. Subsequent analysis where we ignore the confounder is then
possible. which inference on the target population can be achieved. For
example, when there is missing data weights can be used to create a
pseudo-population in which there is no missingness. In the context of
MSMs, the IPT weights relate to a pseudo-population in which there is no
longer any confounding between the confounder and treatment and causal
inferences can be made. \linebreak

Underlying the IPTW method for estimating MSMs are four assumptions: 1)
consistency 2) exchangeability 3) positivity 4) and correct model
specification. Exchangeability, also known as the no unmeasured
confounding assumption, is closely linked to causality?? Several studies
have considered violations of exchangeability and corrected model
specification. Positivity has received less attention because in typical
observational study positivity violations are not suspected explain why.
In the clinical context that we consider, protocols (give some examples,
like Platt 2012) threaten to violate the positivity assumption and we
investigate whether MSMs are robust against positivity. The focus of
this thesis will be on violations of the positivity assumption.
Positivity means that within every strata spanned by the confounders,
there must be a positive probability of patients being exposed or
unexposed to treatment. For example, in a medical context, if treatment
protocols demand that treatment is initiated whenever a prognostic
variable falls below a pre-defined threshold, there will only be exposed
and no unexposed patients in this strata of the confounding prognostic
variable. make decisions based on protocols positivity can be. In the
absence of structural positivity violations, there is always the threat
that random zeroes arise in some strata of the confounder especially
when the sample size is small or the number of confounding variables is
large. In each case the sparsity of data within the strata of the
confounder results in a high chance that positivity is violated.
Positivity violations increase the bias and variance of estimates of the
causal effect but the extent of the damage is not well known. The
central aim of this thesis will be to investigate positivity violations
when fitting MSMs to longitudinal data. To our knowledge positivity
violations have not been systematically studied in the literature from a
simulation point of view. We quantify the bias and variance introduced
due to positivity violations and hope to provide practical advice to
researchers tempted to fit MSMs to overcome confounding without
realising the potential consequences of positivity violations in their
data. \linebreak

Throughout this thesis we focus on clinical applications as examples. In
the literature on marginal structural models the causal effect of
Zidovudine on the survival of HIV positive men is often cited as an
example. In this example a patients white blood cell (CD4) count is a
prognostic variable that influences a doctor's decision to initiate
treatment while at the same time being a predictor of survival. As a
result CD4 count is a confounder. In the longitudinal setting previous
treatments influence CD4 count. As such studies often depend on
protocols which means that poistivity in some levels of the confounder
make this a suitable example for our purposes. \linebreak 

The structure of this thesis is as follows. In section 2 of part 1, the
model considered in this thesis and its important aspects are explained.
In part 2 simulating from this statistical model is discussed in detail.
In part 3 the model under dynamic strategies is considered and
comparisons are drawn with the static case. In part 4 we entertain
violations of positivity in the data, this section represents the
novelty in this thesis. Part 5 conducts a simulation study. Part 6
includes a discussion, conclusions and suggestions for future work.
\linebreak

A second consequence is that simulating data from a specific marginal
structural models is more challenging when the data is to exhibit time
dependent confounding.

Look through literature for applications of MSMs

    Allow for the joint determination of outcomes and treatment status or
omitted variables related to both treatment status and outcomes (Angrist
2001).

A covariate \(L\) is a confounder if it predicts the event of interest
and also predicts subsequent exposure. Explain how this actually
happens, as U0 is a common ancestor of A through L and also Y, also that
there is selection bias, and L is sufficient to adjust for confounding
see Havercroft algorithm code page bottom.

    \subsection{Outline}\label{outline}

In this thesis we assess the impact of violations of the positivity
assumption on the performance of marginal structural models. \linebreak

The first chapter introduces marginal structural models and inverse
probability of treatment weighting. Particular attention is given to the
role of the positivity assumption in MSMs and the trade-off between
finer confounding control and positivity. Chapter 2 explains the issues
surrounding simulating data from a specific MSM with a longitudinal
structure that captures the issues which arise in time dependent
confounding. This chapter includes a literature review of algorithms
that have been developed to simulate from a given marginal structural
model. A particular simulation algorithm which is versatile enough that
it can be used to introduce violations of positivity is then selected
and explained in more detail. Chapter 3 presents simulation results and
key findings. Chapter 4 uses real world data in which positivity
violations arise as a result of treatment protocols in a chemotherapy

    \section{Marginal structural models}\label{marginal-structural-models}

Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a class of models for the
estimation of causal effects from observational data \citet{Robins2000}.
More specifically, marginal structural models allow us to make causal
statements in the presence of time dependent confounding. Several key
assumptions need to be met to achieve this. In this section we describe
MSMs and focus on those assumtpions. This section explains the central
concepts behind marginal structural models and introduces the notation
that will be used in this thesis. Marginal structural models use only
observed data and a set of assumptions to investigate causal effects.
Positivity, the focus of this paper, is tied closely to confounder and,
as we shall see, there is a trade-off between finer confounder control
and positivity. The algorithm adapted in this paper simulates
longitudinal data and hence we discuss time dependent confounding and
the extra bits required for this. In particular, we draw attention to
the core parts of MSMs needed for this study - linking to positivity.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  describe other methods like g formula as alternative to MSMs
\item
  MSMs are models for some aspect (like the mean) of the distribution of
  counterfactuals.
\item
  many types like a marginal structural cox model (maybe let this follow
  on after weights part.
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Counterfactuals and
causality}\label{counterfactuals-and-causality}

In the counterfactual framework (\citet{Neyman1923}, \citet{Rubin1978},
\citet{Robins1986}) the causal effect of treatment \(X\) on outcome
\(Y\) for one subject can be defined as the difference between that
subject's outcome had they been exposed and unexposed to X. In other
words, one outcome is necessarily counterfactual because in reality the
same subject cannot be both exposed and unexposed to \(X\). If we denote
the outcome when exposed as \(Y_{x=1}\) and the outcome when not exposed
as \(Y_{x=0}\) then the causal effect for one subject can be expressed
as \(Y_{x=1} - Y_{x=0}\). For example, suppose a subject with a headache
takes ibuprofen (\(X = 1\)), a popular treatment for headaches. After a
suitable amount of time, say one hour, the headache either remains
\(Y_{x=1} = 1\) or has passed \(Y_{x=1} = 0\). The outcome which is not
observed is the counterfactual outcome that prevails had the subject,
contrary to fact, not taken ibuprofen. In other words, we don't observe
\(Y_{x=0}\). \linebreak

Often we are interested in the average causal effect for a population
rather than for one subject. Suppose sixty subjects are suffering from a
headache and every subject was given ibuprofen. After one hour each
subject will either have a headache (\(Y_{x=1}=1\)) or their headache
will have passed (\(Y_{x=1}=0\)). The average outcome across all
subjects is \(\mathbb{E}(Y_{x = 1})\) or equivalently when \(Y\) is a
dichotomous variable, \(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1})\). The relevant causal
comparison is now between \(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1})\) and
\(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0})\), the latter being the counterfactual had none
of sixty subjects been exposed. We do not observe the quantity
\(Y_{x=0}\) for any subject, and consequently we do not observe the
quantity \(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0})\). \linebreak

Dawid 1979 - we can vary the individual I and treatment X but this is
largely a conceptual entity because only one treatment can in fact be
applied to any unit. - Can also use the odds ratio as the comparison
instead of the risk difference. - only have the data and observed
outcomes, not the counterfactuals. - the collection of outcomes on a
subject are called the potential outcomes and only one of these is
observed

    \subsection{Confounding}\label{confounding}

Continuing the example, if group A consists of thirty of the headache
sufferers who all took ibuprofen, we would ideally compare the quantity
\(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1}|X = 1) = \mu_{A_{x = 1}}\) with the quantity
\(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0}|X = 1) = \mu_{A_{x = 0}}\). As
\(\mu_{A_{x = 0}}\) is not actually observed, we could instead compute
the observable quantity \(\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0}|X = 0) = \mu_{B_{x=0}}\)
from the remaining thirty subjects who did not use ibuprofen and belong
to group B. Replacing the comparison between \(\mu_{A_{x = 1}}\) and
\(\mu_{A_{x = 0}}\) with the comparison between \(\mu_{A_{x = 1}}\) and
\(\mu_{B_{x=0}}\) will have a causal interpretation if
\(\mu_{A_{x = 0}} = \mu_{B_{x=0}}\). In other words, if a subject from
group B can be viewed as an analogue of a subject from group A had they,
contrary to fact, not received ibuprofen. \linebreak

If \(\mu_{A_{x = 1}} \neq \mu_{B_{x=0}}\) then the comparison
\(\mu_{A_{x = 1}} - \mu_{B_{x=0}}\), a measure of association, is
confounded for \(\mu_{A_{x = 1}} - \mu_{A_{x = 0}}\), a measure of
causal effect (\citet{Greenland1999}). For example, if all the subjects
in group A are male it would be reasonable to ask whether their sex
influenced their decision to take ibuprofen. Suppose that males also
tend to have headaches of a shorter duration so that at the end of one
hour they are less likely to have a headache than females. The result is
that both the decision to take ibuprofen and the probability of having a
headache at the end of one hour are dependent on the sex of the subject.
This obscures the causal effect of ibuprofen on headaches because there
is a spurious association between \(X\) and \(Y\) through the subject's
sex. We cannot establish whether the outcome is due to a causal
relationship between ibuprofen and headache alleviation, a relationship
between sex and headache alleviation or a mixture of the two. \linebreak

Closely related to confounding, exchangeability is the assumption that
the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes \(Y_{x}\) is independent
of the actually observed treatment \(X\). When exchangeability holds,
subjects from group A and group B are exchangeable in the sense that
were they all to remain untreated the distribution of the counterfactual
outcomes \(Y_{x}\) would be the same in the two groups
\citet{Daniel2013}. Imagine exchanging a subject from group A with a
subject from group B where both recieve the treatment prevailing in
their new group. Under exchangeability, the average outcome in the two
groups is unchanged \citet{HernanMA2018}. However, exchanging subjects
between group A and group B introduces females into group A and males
into group B. As males have a higher probability that \(Y = 0\),
exchanging subjects changes the distribution of the counterfactuals. The
relationship between confounding and exchangeability is why the
assumption of exchangeability is also called the assumption of "no
unmeasured confounding". \linebreak

    \subsection{Directed Acyclic Graphs: graphical representations of
causality}\label{directed-acyclic-graphs-graphical-representations-of-causality}

Causal relationships, like those described in the previous section, can
be represented using graphs. A graph consists of a finite set of
vertices \(\nu\) and a set of edges \(\epsilon\). The vertices of a
graph correspond to a collection of random variables which follow a
joint probability distribution \(P(\nu)\). Edges in \(\epsilon\) consist
of pairs of distinct vertices and denote a certain relationship that
holds between the variables \citet{Pearl2009}. The absence of an edge
between two variables indicates that the variables are independent of
one another. The direction of the causal relationship is denoted by an
arrow and is acyclic because causal relationships between two variables
only proceed in one direction. There are no feedback loops or mutual
causation because in a causal framework a variable cannot be a cause of
itself directly or indirectly \citet{Hernan2004}.\linebreak

For example, figure ? represents the case where interest is in the
causal relationship between treatment \(X\) and outcome \(Y\). Treatment
is assigned according to conditional distributions \(P(treatment|male)\)
and \(P(treatment|female)\). Once treatment has been assigned, the
outcome \(Y\) is determined by both \(X\) and \(Z\) by the conditional
distribution P(Y\textbar{}X, Z). \citet(Pearl2001\}, \citet(Pearl2014\}.
Blocking or screening off \(Z\) has the same inuition as explained in
the section on confounding. The causal effect of X and Y cannot be
different between two subjects because of \(Z\) when everyone is that
strata has the same value of \(Z\). Blocking is the same as holding
\(Z\) constant. Intuition to drive forward is that difference in outcome
cannot be due to strata when everyone shares that strata.

Show the same graph without causal relationship between X and Y. There
is a marginal dependence between X and Y through Z, but once we
condition on Z this dependence dissapears as shown by the lack of an
edge between X and Y. Once we condition on Z (i.e. we know that the
subject was male of female.) then the margial dependence dissapears.
Introduce idea of common cause here as well.

Both treatment and outcome are determined by sex leading to a spurious
association between \(X\) and \(Y\) through \(Z\). This is called a
"back door" path between \(X\) and \(Y\). Conditioning on \(Z\) is
reprsented graphically by blocking the back door and any spurious
assocations to allow causal estimation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use example of cause by just removing an arrow from the DAG to
  illustrate the point that there must be a cause so adding back the
  causal arrow of interest does not change the fact that part of the
  cause comes through the confounder.

\item

    \subsection{Time dependent
confounding}\label{time-dependent-confounding}

So far we have considered the time fixed context in which treatment and
confounders take on a single value. It was sufficient to block the "back
door" path between the treatment and outcome by conditioning on the
confounding variable(s). In the headache example, the causal effect of
ibuprofen on headache alleviation was confounded by sex. For most
people, sex is a time-fixed covariate because it does not change value
over time. To broaden the setting to a time dependent context, we adopt
the canonical example of the causal effect of Zidovudine (AZT) on
mortality amongst human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects
\citet{Hernan2000}. In this example, subjects are measured at baseline
\(t = 0\) and at subsequent visits. In each visit the patient's CD4
lymphocyte count is measured and a treatment decision made. Survival at
the end of follow-up is a binary outcome equal to 1 if the patient has
died and 0 otherwise. \linebreak

The time-fixed notation can be extended to include subject histories for
time varying variables. Treatment and covariate histories up to visit
\(k\) are can be represented by an overhead bar. For example,
\(\bar X_{k} = \{X_{0}, \hdots, X_{k}\}\) represented the vector of
treatment decisions while \(\bar Z_{k} = \{Z_{0}, \hdots, Z_{k}\}\)
represents the vector of measurements on the time dependent-confounder
\(Z\). Time-fixed covariates like sex, or covariates which change
linearly over time like age are tyically recorded at baseline
(\(t = 0\)) and we denote the collection of baseline covariates as
\(V_{0}\). The outcome of interest at the end of follow-up is mortality
\(Y\) which is a binary variable taking the value \(1\) if the patient
is dead and \(0\) otherwise. \linebreak 

Just as in the time-fixed case, time-dependent confounders lead to
spurious associations between \(X\) and \(Y\) through a "back door" path
between \(X\) and \(Y\) through \(L\). To estimate a causal effect it is
necessary to block this path by conditioning on the confounding
variables. Figure ? gives an example of this in the time dependent case
for two periods (\(t = 0, 1\)). In the first period a treatment decision
is made based on the measured confounder \(Z_0\). In the second period
(\(t = 1\)) a new treatment decision is made based on both \(Z_0\) and
\(Z_1\). Conditioning on \(\bar Z\) under this DAG leads to a consistent
estimate of the causal effect because doing so blocks all paths between
\(X_0\) and \(X_1\) and \(Y\) except the causal path of interest.
\linebreak

However, the time-dependent context also admits structures like the
middle pane of figure ? with the addition of a causal relationship
between \(X_0\) and \(Z_1\). It is now possible for current treatments
to be a determinant of future confounders which are in turn determinants
of future treatment \citet{Robins2000a}. As a result the effect of
\(A_0\) on \(Y\) is mediated through \(L_1\) in the path
\(A_0 \rightarrow L_1 \rightarrow Y\). Blocking this path by
conditioning on \(Z\) also blocks some portion of the effect of \(A_0\)
on \(Y\) and will lead to a biased estimate. \linebreak

A second danger in the time-dependent context arises when \(Z\) is a
common effect of treatment and an unmeasured variable \(U\) which also
influences the outcome \(Y\). There is no direct association Figure ?
shows the same two structures with the addition of a an unmeasured
variable \(U\) which influences \(Z\) and \(Y\). Conditioning on \(Z\).
Selection bias precludes unbiased estimation \citet{Hernan2004}. There
is a mediating relationship between \(A\) and \(Z\) in which case there
is a spurious relationship between \(A\) and \(Y\) again? This is less
inuitive and so examples are best according to \citet{Cole2010}. We can
say that Z is a common effect of A and U, once we condition on Z we
create a dependence of A on U. U is a cause of Y and hence there is an
association between A and Y. This association is present even when there
is no direct causal path between A and Y. \linebreak

Hazard ratios and selection bias \citet{Hernan2010}. Actual application
will look at toxicity of treatment. Somepeople will be suceptible and
drop out leaving more people in the untreated arm of the study.

general point about selection bias is that the general population is not
a valid control group.

Conclusion, 1) clearly a different technique is required for analysis 2)
the nature of time dependent case needs to be described fully enough to
explain why we choose the simulation algorithm that we choose and any
holes in it. In subsequent sections our choice of simulation algorithm
will be motivated by the structure of time dependent confounding as well
as the viability of introducing positivity violations which are
propogated through the time dependent structure. Explain meaning of a
collider and that a collider that is conditioned on will not block
confounding. Essentially with this kind of data we cannot use
confoudning or stratification methods.

    \subsection{Inverse Probability of Treatment
Weighting}\label{inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting}

The previous section has highlighted how standard approaches for
controlling for confounding in a time dependent context may lead to
biased estimates. In this section we describe a technique called inverse
probability of treatment weighting that can be used to obtain unbiased
estimates of the causal effect of treatment on outcome in the presence
of time dependent confounding.

Inverse probability of treatment weighting is a technique that can be
used to obtain unbiased estimates of the causal effect of treatment on
outcome in the presence of time dependent confounding. The intuition
behind the technique is that by re-weighting the data a pseudopopulation
is created in which the treatment is independent of any measured
confounders. Regression analysis on the pseudopopulation can be carried
out without the need to control for confounders eliminating the problems
which arose in the previous section due to conditioning on \(Z\).
Crucially, in the pseudopopulation, the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\)
remains unchanged. As a result, it is possible to estimate the true
causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\).

\paragraph{Construction of weights}\label{construction-of-weights}

  why does it work and naive methods do not?

\item
  Dangers associated with startification and controlling for methods

\item
  Because we need weights this means we need a model for the weights -

\item
  Contrast IPTW methods with stratification methods.
\end{itemize}

\citet{Horvitz1952} Areas where IPTW has been used (time dependent
confounding, comparing dynamic regimes, missing data)

Inverse probability of treatment weighting is a technique that
re-weights subject observations to a population where assignment of
treatment is at random. An early example of this technique is the
\citet{Horovitz1952} weighted estimator of the mean. In the context of
marginal structural models, a weight is calculated for each subject
which can be thought of informally as the inverse of the probability
that a subject receives their own treatment \citet{Robins2000}. The
result of applying these weights is to re-weight the data to create a
pseudo-population in which treatment is independent of measured
confounders \citet{Cole2008}. Crucially, in the pseudo population the
counterfactual probabilities are the same as in the true study
population so that the causal RD, RR or OR are the same in both
populations \citet{Robins2000}.

\[w_{t,i} = \frac{1}{\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i})}\]

stabilized weights
\[sw_{it} = \frac{\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i})} {\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i})}\]

The use of IPTW is valid under the four assumptions of consistency,
exchangeability, positivity and no misspecification of the model
\citet{Cole2008}.

Informally a patients weight through visit k is proportional to the
inverse of the probability of having her own exposure history through
visit k (Cole and Hernan 2008)

The weight is informally proportional to the participants probability of
receiving her own exposure history

As these weights have high instability we need to stabilize them. The
unstabilized weights can be driven by only a small number of
observations. Why are they unstable?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  true weights are unknown but can be estimated from the data.
\item
  \(A_t\) is no longer affected by \(L_t\), and crucially the causal
  effect of \(\bar A\) on \(Y\) remains unchanged
\end{itemize}

Be more specific about what is contained in the weights. The denominator
depends on the measured confounders \(L\) the numerator does not.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  weighted regression and MSM are equivalent.
\end{itemize}

Point out that we need baseline variables in the conditional statments
in the num and denom of the weights otherwise we break the relationship
between outcome and baselines in the new pseudo-population. If the
baseline variables are not confounders, then we do not want to break
this relationship. Baseline covariates also help to stabalize the
weights (how?)

importantly, changing the relationship between L and A, won;t change the
relationship between L and Y. This means that an intervention in \(A\)
does not affect the relationship between \(L\) and \(Y\). So we remove
the link between \(L\) and \(A\) and assign to \(A\) the value of
treatment on or off. Once we place the patient on treatment, regardless
of the relationship which had existed before hand between the covariate
and treatment, a new relationship between \(A\) and \(Y\) exists in
which the covariate has no say.

\subsubsection{Applications of IPTW}\label{applications-of-iptw}

Different from application of MSMs - IPW is a technique which has been
applied to MSMs - i.e. MSMs are on example of how IPTW can be used.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Crucial that the relationship between Y and X remains the same in the
  new population. I.e. the marginal structural model is the same.
\end{itemize}

    \subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}

This section presents a more formalises the definition of the five
assumptions underlying MSMs. The assumption of no unmeasured confounders
has received the most attention in the literature (). Most attention
will be given to positivity. Conditions under which IPTW work are
largely untestable (westreich 2012)

\subsubsection{No unmeasured
confounders}\label{no-unmeasured-confounders}

\[Y_{x} \perp\!\!\!\perp X\]

\subsubsection{Consistency}\label{consistency}

The consistency assumption states that the actual outcome is equal to
the potential outcome under the treatment assignment which is actually
taken. Every subject has a set of potential outcomes associated with the
possible treatment or treatment history they can receive. Only one of
these potential outcomes is factual and what the consistency assumption
tells us is that factual outcome is equal to the potential outcome
corresponding to the factual treatment. As a result we can write the
following.

\[P(Y_x = y\ |\ Z = z, X = x) = P(Y = y\ |\ Z = z, X = x)\]

In words, the probability that the potential outcome \(Y_x\) is equal to
the observed outcome \(y\) is itself equal to the probability that the
observed outcome equals \(y\) whenever \(X = x\) and for any covariate
\(Z\).

Several authors have discussed whether the consistency assumption is
really an assumption or if it is a definition or axiom. The interested
reader is referred to \citet{VanderWeele2009}, \citet{Cole2009} and
\citet{Pearl2010}.

\subsubsection{No model mispecification}\label{no-model-mispecification}

Two models are estimated in marginal structural models. The structural
model itself and the weight model. In both cases correct model
specification is necessary to achieve consistent results. Typically the
time the "no model mispecification" assumption refers to the weight
model. Within a simulation context we can study the performance of the
IPTW model in the complete absence of model mispecification because we
specify the model.

Correct specifcation of the inverse probability weighting (IPW) model is
necessary for consistent inference from a marginal structural Cox model
(MSCM).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What effect does this have? Are weights more unstable?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{No measurement error}\label{no-measurement-error}

\subsubsection{Positivity.}\label{positivity.}

The final assumption underlying MSMs, and the central topic of this
thesis, is the positivity assumption. MSMs are used to estimate average
causal effects in the study population, and one must therefore be able
to estimate the average causal effect in every subset of the population
defined by the confounders \citet{Cole2008}. The positivity assumption
requires that there be exposed and unexposed individuals in every strata
of the confounding covariates. For example, when treatment is Zidovudine
and CD4 count is the confounder, there must be a positive probability of
some patients being exposed and unexposed at every level of CD4 count.
Positivity can be expressed formally as \(Pr(A=a\ |\ L) > 0\) for all
\(a \in A\), which extends straightforwardly to the time dependent case
where the positivity assumption must hold at every time step conditonal
on previous treatment, time dependent confounders and any baseline
covaraiates:

\[Pr(A_{it}=a_{it}\ |\ L_{it}, A_{i, t-1}, V_{i0}) > 0\]

Models for the risk \(P(Y=1\ |\ A=a, L=l)\) are commonly studied in
epidemiological applications. Applying basic probability rules reveals
that the risk can be re-written with the term \(Pr(A=a\ |\ L=l)\) in the
denominator:

\[P(Y=1\ |\ A=a, L=l) = \frac{P(Y=1, A=a, L=l)}{Pr(A=a, L=l)} = \frac{P(Y=1, A=a, L=l)}{Pr(A=a\ |\ L=l)Pr(L=l)}\]

This model is only estimable when \(Pr(A=a\ |\ L=l) \neq 0\). Therefore,
when positivity does not hold it is not possible to estimate the model.
In the context of MSMs a similar problem emerges. Although weighting via
IPTW allows naive estimation of (?) without including the confounders,
the weights in (?) involved the term \(Pr(A=a\ |\ L=l)\) in the
denominator. This means that the weights are inestimable whenever
positivity is violated. In order to estimate the causal effect of \(A\)
on \(Y\), weights must be estimable in every subset of the population
otherwise the average causal effect in the study population cannot be
estimated. \linebreak

In practice, positivity can arise when random zeroes or structural
zeroes are present in some levels of the confounding covariates. Random
zeroes arise when, by chance, no individuals or all individuals, receive
treatment within a certain strata as defined by the covariates. For
example, \citet{Cole2008} studies positivity violations in individuals
in strata defined by CD4 count and viral load. By increasing the levels
of CD4 count the chances of random zeroes also increases and
\citet{Cole2008} show that the IPT weights rapidly lose their stability
with the consequence that causal effects are no longer estimable.
Researchers applying IPTW methods must actively check that there are
both treated and untreated individuals at every level of their
covariates within cells defined by their covariates because parametric
methods will smooth over positivity violations and not provide any
indication of nonpositivity. Increasingly refined covariates are
attractive because they provide better control of confounding, but the
point that \citet{Cole2008} make is that this control needs to be traded
off against increased occurence of random zeroes and subsequent
instability of IPT weights. \linebreak

More relevant to this thesis are violations of the positivity assumption
due to structural zeroes. These occur when an individual cannot possibly
be treated or if an individual is always treated within some levels of
the confounding covariate, as is the case in the clinical protocol
example motivating this thesis. Several studies give examples of
structural violations of the positivity assumption in epidemiological
contexts. In \citet{Cole2008} structural zeroes arise when the health
effects due to exposure to a chemical are confounded by health status
proxied by being at work. If individuals can only be exposed to the
chemical at work then all individuals not at work will be unexposed. A
second example is liver disease as a contraindication of treatment. If
individuals with liver disease cannot be treated then all individuals in
the "liver disease = 1" strata will be untreated. In \citet{Messer2010}
structural zeroes arise in the context of rates of preterm birth and
racial segregation, whereas \citet{Cheng2010} find structural zeroes in
the context of fetal position and perinatal outcomes. Our motivating
example is most closely related to liver disease as a contraindication,
except that the clinical protocols require that patients with low CD4
count always be treated instead of never being treated, as in the case
in the liver disease example. \linebreak

Although in many epidemiological settings the positivity assumption is
guaranteed by experimental design, studying positivity violations is
relevant because, as our own motivating example and the examples above
suggest, structural violations do occur, and random zeroes are always
possible especially at finer levels of confounding covariates. Studying
the finite sample propoerties of MSMs under violations to positivity is
therefore an important issue which is yet to be dealt with
systematically in the literature. As \citet{Westreich2010} points out,
positivity violations, positivity violations by a time varying
confounder pose an analytic challenge and they suggest g-estimation or
g-computation may be a way forward. A good start to dealing with the
time varying confounder case is to see how well MSMs work when
positivity is violated. This is also a novelty of this thesis.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{5}
\tightlist
\item
  estimated weights with a mean far from one, or very extreme values
  indicate either non-positivity or model mispecification of the weight
  model.
\item
  It is not always true that we want more finely tuned covariates for
  confounder control because the bias and variance of the effect
  estimate may increase with the number of categories. This is similar
  to the positivity masking example.
\item
  Our results are equally valid for other circumstances in which
  positivity may arise.
\item
  Also think about how the number of categories of exposure increases
  the chance that one level of exposure will have a positivity.
\item
  Westreich and Cole 2010 have suggested that methodological approaches
  are needed to weigh the resultant biases incurred when trading of
  confounding and positivity. The framework we use is flexible enough to
  allow this in a simulation setting.
\end{enumerate}

If the structural bias occurs within levels of a time-dependent
confounder then restriction or censoring may lead to bias whether one
uses weighting or other methods (Cole and Hernan 2008). In fact,
weighted estimates are more sensitive to random zeroes (Cole, Hernan,
2008) Introducing violations of positivity can be achieved by censoring
observations.

But to give an intuitive example, think about how it links back to a
situation where sicker patients receive treatment compared to others. So
in the "sick" strata of the CD4 count \textbf{ALL} patients receive
treatment which inflates the IPTW. This also affects how we think about
the associational versus causal models. The causal effect might be 50/50
but because sicker patients get treatment the mortality ratio in the
treated group is likely to be higher.

The trade-off between positivity and confounding bias is emphasized in
Cole2008

Why is practicality important? Cole paper highlights practical advice to
practictioners. positivity can be violated in a practical setting
because of two few strata, it can be the result of protocols in a
clinical setting and it can be seen as a trade-off between
exchangeability (and we need more measured predictors to maintain
exchangeability) and positivity where more predictors leads to more
likely a zero problem.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dynamic stratgies evaluated using MSMs will have rules like, start
  treatment if CD4 falls below a certain threshold. See Didelez
  presentation on this
\item
  Explain that there is positivity in estimation of the structural model
  and also in the weight model. The reason why positivity is more
  important in the weight model is because when the weights are unstable
  the estimates can be very wrong as a result.

A model that parameterises \(P(Y\ |\ do(A=a))\) is called a marginal
structural model (MSM) as it is marginal over any covariates and
structural in the sense that it represents an interventional rather than
observational model.

    \section{Simulating from marginal structural
models}\label{simulating-from-marginal-structural-models}

In order to assess the impact of violations of the positivity assumption
on the performance of the IPTW estimator we simulate data from a
specific marginal structural model in a series of monte carlo
simulations. In this chapter we start by describing the logic behin
monte carlo simulations in general terms. Next, we consider several
important criteria that a simulation model must exhibit in the context
of MSMs. In particular we require an algorithm that can simulate from a
specific MSM, has the observational structure described earlier and we
also define noncollapsibility. Several algorithms have been proposed in
the literature and these are briefly discussed and compared. We then
focus on the algorithm suggested in \citet{Havercroft2010} and explain
why it satisfies our requirements. The most salient aspects of this
algorithm for the purposes of this thesis are described.

\paragraph{Monte Carlo Simulations}\label{monte-carlo-simulations}

In statistical research interest often lies in the estimation of a
population parameter \(\theta\). When only a sample \(X_1\) from the
population is available, statistical methods are applied to obtain an
estimate of the population parameter \(\hat \theta_1\). If a second
sample \(X_2\) is drawn from the population it will result in second
estimate \(\hat \theta_2\) and so on for more samples.

Alternatively, a known "true" model governing key relationships can be
specified and a sample of data generated according to that model. For
example, a logistic model for a binary covariate aThe success of a
technique can be compared to the true model. Any single sample generated

\end{itemize}

specify general steps in the agorithm

Naturally this requires knowing the parameters in advance in order to
simulate from the model. In the case of MSMs this requires simulating
from a specific MSM

\paragraph{Specific MSM}\label{specific-msm}

Testing positivity violations requires generating data from a known MSM.
For example, suppose that the chosen MSM was
\(P(Y\ |\ do(a)) = \alpha + \beta a\), then the observational data from
which this is derived would be \(Y\), \(A\) and \(L\). The simulation
needs to allow \(\beta\) to be estimated from only that observational
data. In order to simulating from a specific MSM we need to generate
observational data in such a way that it conforms to a specific MSM. For
instance, one specific MSM could be written as
\(P(Y\ |\ do(a)) = \alpha + \beta a\). However, we never see this so we
need to generate data in such a way that we get this model from
observational data and that we can then return to it.

\paragraph{observational structure}\label{observational-structure}

The discussion of confounding and time dependent confounding above
highlighted several important aspects of observational data. Firstly,
confounding arises in observational data when subjects from the treated
and untreated groups are not exchangeable. In other words, The
observational structure needs to include the central parts of time
dependent confounding - in particular Y and A are common effects of U
which creates a confounding relationship. We also need selection bias,
some models like hazard ratios have a built in selection bias so this is
particularly important.

\paragraph{noncollapsibility}\label{noncollapsibility}

Noncollapsibility arises when the marginal effect measure (marginal over
any covariates, i.e. unstratified or with no confounder control, crude)
is not equal to the strata specific effect measure. This is a problem
when simulating from marginal structural models because the correct
marginal structural model

\[correct marginal structural model\] \[model with covariates\]
\[collapsed ovr covariates and not equal to marginal model\]

In previous sections we descrie the necessity of controlling for
confounding variables when estimating causal effects.

Collapsibility starts with the notion of confounders. We assume that
within strata of confounders that the effect of the confounder is
homogenous. I.e. in the female strata, the effect of being female is
homogenous.

\citet{Greenland1996}, \citet{Greenland1999}, \citet{Greenland2011},
\citet{Sjoelander2016}

The effect of treatment on diesease outcome may be unconfounded but
noncollapsible

Collapsibility is the same as simoson's paradox if we adopt the
definition that without the conditional variable they can be equal.

collapsibility depends on the measure used. Some are collapsible and
some are not

Could arise in two ways 1) within strata effect measures may not be the
same 2) Even if they are the same they may not equal the marginal effect
measure (marginal over any covariates Z)

Collapsibility means there is no incompatibility between the marginal
model and the conditional distributions used to simulate the data.
Provide example of this. Explain how this affects the simulation
algorithm. Especially hazard ratios which are non-collapsible.

Models are noncollapsible when conditioning on a covariate
\textbf{related to the outcome} changes the size of the estimate even
when the covariate is unrelated to the exposure. Illustrate why this
happens with survival models.

Collapsability comes in because we cannot collapse a model conditional
on L into one conditional on only A.

Survival models are non-collapsible. Hence we cannot eaily simulate from
them. Instead we use U as a sneaky trick. Explain why survival models
are non-collapsible

This is particularly important because collapsibility and confounding
are often treated as identical concepts when in fact they are not.

Several algorithms for simulating from a specific MSM have ben suggested
in the literature.

\item

  positivity according to protocols? At baseline the proportion of
  people in any CD4 strata was unknown but randomized and hence in
  expectation it should be the same in treated and untreated.
\item
  Young 2014 - Law of the observed outcome conditional on the measured
  past. What this paper shows is that the regression results are not
  correct but the IPTW ones are fine. The issues is comparing IPTW to
  normal regression results. As we compare IPTW results to IPTW results
  under positivity it should be fine to use the Havercroft algorithm.

\begin{itemize}

  specific MSM, the observational structure and collapsibiity
\item
  collapsibility is a problem because we cannot collapse over L to get

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm with positivity
violations.}\label{algorithm-with-positivity-violations.}

The confounding structure occurs because there is a relationship between
A and Y confounded through L through U? Y and A are common effects of U
which creates an association between A and Y other than the causal
association we want to study in the MSM - refer to structural bias
paper.

The parameter of interest could be expected survival or the five year
survival probability

Need to specify what the MSM is, give an example of it as a hazard
function. Survival is completeley determined by the hazard function.

U allows us to get any distribution we like for Y marginal over
covariates, WOuld L itself allows this? probably not. We can somehow get
from this the subjects counterfactual survival time.

Importantly, this expression on the left hand side has unobserved
counterfactuals, but the right hand side has only observed quantities
which would be observed in an actual observational study.

non-collapsibility is an unresolved issue here. So even if we
investigate positivity we can still only do so for collapsible models?

Equivalent way of motivating dividing the joint distribution by
Pr(A\textbar{}L) is through IPTW.

The important point is to resolve the correct, causal parameter on a

How does selection bias relate to \(U\)?

  \(P(Y\ |\ do(a))\) to observattional data generated in an
  observational way. But the problem arises when the model is
  non-collapsible or non-linear.
\end{enumerate}

In the one shot case we set A = 1/0 because we are interested in the
outcome under either of these treatment scenarios. In the time dependent
case, A is a vector of 0s and 1s and we want to pretend that we decide
in advance that the whole vector A is specified. But A and L have a
complex interplay in an observational setting. So we want to pretend
that A (a vector of 1s and 0s) is set in advance but at the same time
have the observational structure for A and L.

The relationship between Y and L is then dependent on A. There is no
relationship between A and U because of the set-up in the DAG. The
variable L blocks this relationship.

In their paper \citet{Havercroft2012} develop an algorithm that allows
simulating data that corresponds to a particular parameterisation of an
MSM. This algorithm provides the bedrock of the simulation structure
considered in this thesis. Figure 1 represents the system under
consideration. The DAG in figure 1 represents the one-shot
non-longitudinal case. Factorising the joint distributions of the
variables in figure 1 yields

\[P(U,\ L,\ W,\ A,\ Y) = P(W)P(U)P(W)P(L\ |\ U)P(A\ |\ L,W)P(Y\ |\ U,A)\]

Where, following definition 1.1 we delete \(P(A\ |\ L,W)\), a
probability function corresponding to \(A\), and replace \(A=a\) in all
remaining functions

\[ P(U, L, W, Y\ |\ do(A=a)) =
  \begin{cases}
    P(U)P(L\ |\ U)P(Y\ |\ U,A = a) & \quad \text{if } A = a\\
    0  & \quad \text{if } A \neq a\\
  \end{cases}
\]

The goal is to simulate from a particular MSM. This means parameterising
\(P(Y\ |\ do(A=a))\). Applying the law of total probability over \(W\),
\(U\) and \(L\) yields

\[P(Y\ |\ do(A=a) = \sum_{w, u, l} P(W)P(U)P(L\ |\ U)P(Y\ |\ U, L, A=a) = \sum_{u, l} P(U)P(L\ |\ U)P(Y\ |\ U, L, A=a)\]

Making use of the fact that
\(P(L, U) = P(L\ |\  U)P(U) = P(U\ |\ L)P(L)\) and summing over either W
and U or W and L yields

\[P(Y\ |\ do(A=a) = \sum_{l}P(Y\ |\ L, A=a)P(L) = \sum_{u} P(Y\ |\ U, A=a)P(U))\]

If we can find suitable forms for either \(P(Y\ |\ L, A=a)\) and
\(P(L)\) or \(P(Y\ |\ U, A=a)\) and \(P(U)\) that correspond to the MSM
\(P(Y\ |\ do(A=a)\), then, given suitable values for \(A, L, U\) it will
be possible to simulate from the chosen MSM.

Choosing a functional form for \[P(Y\ |\ do(A=a)\] depends on
convenience. We need a functional form that can be easily represented by
\(P(Y\ |\ L, A=a)P(L)\). non-linear functions will be hard to work into
the analysis.

U \textasciitilde{} U{[}0, 1{]} is a good choice because we can usethe
CDF of Y because U{[}0, 1{]} is always between 0 and 1

General health is patient specific but comes from a clear distribution
and has a nice medical interpretation. In contrast L would be more
difficult to include. It is better as a function of U than a value in of
itself.

\end{itemize}

    \section{Violations of Positivity}\label{violations-of-positivity}

The motivation for using the algorith of \citet{Havercroft2012} is that
we have control over how \(L\) affects \(Y\), so we can itroduce
positivity using a threshold. In other algorithms there would be a
direct link between \(L\) and \(Y\), this would be a problem because
altering treatment decisions based on \(L\) would affect \(Y\)
directly.\\
- creating an artificial population in which positivity is violated in
specific ways.

\subsection{Extended discussion of algorithm linking to
positivity}\label{extended-discussion-of-algorithm-linking-to-positivity}

As described in the introduction, one assumption of the model is that
there is a non-zero probability of the event occuring at every startum
of the covariate.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When previous covariates like CD4 count are strongly associated with
  treatment the probabilities in the denominator of the ustabilized
  weights may vary greatly. Because we are foricing positivity by using
  a treatment rule when L falls below a threshold and A is then eaual to
  one, we create a strong association between A and L -\textgreater{}
  hence the unstabilized weights would vary. (Robins et al 2000 pp. 553)

\subsection{Varying levels of
threshold.}\label{varying-levels-of-threshold.}

We wish to simulate survival data in discrete time \(t = 0, \dots, T\)
for \(n\) subjects. At baseline \(t=0\) all subjects are assumed to be
at risk of failure so that \(Y_0 = 0\). For each time period
\(t = 0, \dots, T\) a subject may either be on treatment, \(A_t = 1\),
or not on treatment, \(A_t = 0\). All patients are assumed to be not on
treatment before the study begins. Once a patient commences treatment,
they remain on treatment in all subsequent periods until failure or the
end of follow-up. In each time period \(L_t\) is the value of a
covariate measured at time \(t\). In the simulated data, \(L_t\) behaves
in a similar manner to CD4 counts such that a low value of \(L_t\)
represents a more severe illness and hence a higher probability of both
tratemnt and failure in the following period. In addition to \(L_t\),
the variable \(U_t\) represents subject specific general health at time
\(t\). Although we will simulate \(U_t\), in a real world application
\(U_t\) is an unmeasured confounder which

Each time period is either a check up visit or is between two check up
visits. If \(t\) is a check-up visit and treatment has not yet
commenced, \(L_t\) is measured and a decision is made on whether to
commence treatment. Between visits, treatment remains unchanged at the
value recorded at the previous visit. Similarly, \(L_t\) which is only
measured when \(t\) is a visit, alos remains unchanged.

We represent the history of a random variable with an over bar. For
example, the vector representing the treatment history of the variable A
is represented by \(\bar A = [a_0, a_1, \dots, a_m]\) where \(m=T\) if
the subject survives until the end of follow-up, or \(m < T\) otherwise.

\subsubsection{Algorithm}\label{algorithm}

Next, we describe the algorithm used to simulate data from our chosen
marginal structural model under time dependent confounding. In the
following section we discuss in detail how the algorithm works and the
salient features for this thesis. The algorithm is taken from
\citet{Havercroft2012} who generate data on \(n\) patients, for \(k\)
time periods. The outer loop in the following algorithm
\(i \in {1, \dots, n}\) , refers to the patients while the inner loop
\(t \in {1, \dots, T}\) refers to the subsject specific time periods
from baseline to failure or the end of the study. There will be at least
one, and at most \(T\) records for each patient.

 \caption{Simulation Algoirthm MSM}
\end{algorithm}

Within the inner loop (\(t \in {1, \dots, T}\)) we see that the data is
only updated at time \(t \neq 0\ (mod\ k)\), where \(k\) refers to
evenly spaced check-up visits. If \(t\) is not a check-up visit the
values of \(A_t\) and \(L_t\) are the same as in \(t-1\). When \(t\) is
a visit \(A_t\) and \(L_t\) are updated.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if treatment has been commenced then a subject may feel extra benefit
  if more time has elapsed since treatment began
\item
  L\_t affects A\_t and also Y\_t
\item
  explain starting values for A and Y are all zero (except L maybe)
\end{itemize}

In order to operationalize the Algorithm 1 we need to choose parameters
for \(()\). In their paper \citet{Havercroft2012} use values that
simulate data with a close resemblance to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. We
postpone disussion of the patameters in Algorithm 1 to section 2.4. We
just need to state that we follow their parameters because this is not
the focus of this thesis.

\subsubsection{Discussion of how algorithm
works}\label{discussion-of-how-algorithm-works}

The algorithm of \citet{Havercroft2012} works by factorizing the joint
density of the histories of the four variables in the analysis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Important is that the form of the MSM is not specified intil the last
  stage
\item
  role of \(U_{0, i}\)
\item
  How does positivity enter the analysis?
\item
  Why this model is important in terms of positivity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constructing IPT weights}\label{constructing-ipt-weights}

Inverse Probability of Treatment weights can be used to adjust for
measured confounding and selection bias in marginal structural models.
Link back to pseudo population idea in previous section. This method
relies on four assumptions consistency, exchangeability, positivity and
no mispecification of the model used to estimate the weights
\citet{Cole2008}. Unstabilized weights are defined as:

\[w_{t,i} = \frac{1}{\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i})}\]

Where the denominator is the probability that the subject received the
particular treatment history that they were observed to receive up to
time \(t\), given their prior observed treatment and covariate histories
(Havercroft, Didelez, 2012). The probabilities
\(p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i})\) may
vary greatly between subjects when the covariate history is strongly
asscoaited with treatment. In terms of the resulting pseudopopulation,
very small values of the unstabilized weights for some subjects would
result in a small number of observations dominating the weighted
analysis. The result is that the IPTW estimator of the coefficients will
have a large variance, and will fail to be normally distributed. This
variability can be mitigated by using the following stabilized weights

\[sw_{it} = \frac{\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i})} {\prod_{\tau=0} ^ t p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i})}\]

In the case that there is no confounding the denominator probabiliies in
the stabilized weights reduce to
\(p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i})\) and \(sw_{it}=1\) so
that each subject contributes the same weight. In the case of
confounding this will not be the case and the stabilized weight will
vary around 1.

In practice, we estimate the weights from the data using a pooled
logistic model for the numerator and denominator probabilities. The
histories of the treatment and covariates are included in the
probabilities. In practice Specifically, following Havercroft and
Didelez (2012), we estimate the model where the visit is only the visits
every check up time. Between check ups both the treatment and covariate
remain the same. Other ways of doing this include a spline function over
the months to create a smooth function between the visits. Another
difference might be to use a coxph function instead of logistic function

\[logit\ p_{\tau} (A_{\tau, i}\ |\ \bar A_{\tau-1, i}, \bar L_{\tau, i}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 k + \alpha_2 a_{k-1} + \dots + \alpha_k a_0 + \]

We have several options for estimating these weights. We could use a
coxph model, or a logistic model.

\subsection{Simulation Set-up}\label{simulation-set-up}

We follow the simulation set-up of Havercroft, Didelez (2012) which is
based on parameters that closely match the Swiss HIV Cohort Study
(HAART).

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  check the distribution of the weights that come out of the model (see
  Cole 2008). This would allow us to see weight model mispecifications.
  Not a problem in the simuation case.
\item
  compare the bias, se, MSE, and 95\% confidence interval
\item
  compare all of these in the positivity violation and non-positivty
  violation case.
\item
  explain to some extent monte-carlo standard error.
\item
  we don't confirm the results of the havercroft of Bryan papers,
  instead refer readers to these papers to see how IPTW outperforms the
  naive estimators.
\end{itemize}
