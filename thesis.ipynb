    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a popular class of models for performing causal inference in the presence of time dependent confounders. These models have an important application in areas of research such as epidemiology, social sciences and economics where randomised trials are prohibited by ethical or financial considerations, and hence confounding cannot be ruled out by randomization. Under these circumstances confounding can obscure the causal effect of treatment on outcome. An example of this, common in epidemiological studies, occurs when prognostic variables inform treatment decisions while at same time being predictors of the outcome of interest. In a longitudinal setting this is further complicated when the confounder itself is determined by earlier treatment. One consequence is that regression adjustment methods do not control for confounding in the longitudinal case and other techniques are required. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "The Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) estimator is a technique which leads to consistent estimates in the presence of  has been applied to censoring, missing data and survey design problems. The central idea is that by weighting the observed data in order to create a pseudo population is constructed in which treatemnt is assigned at random. Subsequent analysis where we ignore the confounder is then possible. which inference on the target population can be achieved. For example, when there is missing data weights can be used to create a pseudo-population in which there is no missingness. In the context of MSMs, the IPT weights relate to a pseudo-population in which there is no longer any confounding between the confounder and treatment and causal inferences can be made. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Underlying the IPTW method for estimating MSMs are four assumptions: 1) consistency 2) exchangeability 3) positivity 4) and correct model specification. Exchangeability, also known as the no unmeasured confounding assumption,  is closely linked to causality?? Several studies have considered violations of exchangeability and corrected model specification. Positivity has received less attention because in typical observational study positivity violations are not suspected explain why. In the clinical context that we consider, protocols (give some examples, like Platt 2012) threaten to violate the positivity assumption and we investigate whether MSMs are robust against positivity. The focus of this thesis will be on violations of the positivity assumption. Positivity means that within every strata spanned by the confounders, there must be a positive probability of patients being exposed or unexposed to treatment. For example, in a medical context, if treatment protocols demand that treatment is initiated whenever a prognostic variable falls below a pre-defined threshold, there will only be exposed and no unexposed patients in this strata of the confounding prognostic variable.  make decisions based on protocols positivity can be. In the absence of structural positivity violations, there is always the threat that random zeroes arise in some strata of the confounder especially when the sample size is small or the number of confounding variables is large. In each case the sparsity of data within the strata of the confounder results in a high chance that positivity is violated. Positivity violations increase the bias and variance of estimates of the causal effect but the extent of the damage is not well known. The central aim of this thesis will be to investigate positivity violations when fitting MSMs to longitudinal data. To our knowledge positivity violations have not been systematically studied in the literature from a simulation point of view. We quantify the bias and variance introduced due to positivity violations and hope to provide practical advice to researchers tempted to fit MSMs to overcome confounding without realising the potential consequences of positivity violations in their data. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this thesis we focus on clinical applications as examples. In the literature on marginal structural models the causal effect of Zidovudine on the survival of HIV positive men is often cited as an example. In this example a patients white blood cell (CD4) count is a prognostic variable that influences a doctor's decision to initiate treatment while at the same time being a predictor of survival. As a result CD4 count is a confounder. In the longitudinal setting previous treatments influence CD4 count. As such studies often depend on protocols which means that poistivity in some levels of the confounder make this a suitable example for our purposes. \\linebreak \n",

In part 4 we entertain violations of positivity in the data, this section represents the novelty in this thesis. Part 5 conducts a simulation study. Part 6 includes a discussion, conclusions and suggestions for future work. \\linebreak\n",

    "The first chapter introduces marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Particular attention is given to the role of the positivity assumption in MSMs and the trade-off between finer confounding control and positivity. Chapter 2 explains the issues surrounding simulating data from a specific MSM with a longitudinal structure that captures the issues which arise in time dependent confounding. This chapter includes a literature review of algorithms that have been developed to simulate from a given marginal structural model. A particular simulation algorithm which is versatile enough that it can be used to introduce violations of positivity is then selected and explained in more detail. Chapter 3 presents simulation results and key findings. Chapter 4 uses real world data in which positivity violations arise as a result of treatment protocols in a chemotherapy trial. The last chapter concludes and provides limitations and directions for future work. "

    "# Marginal structural models\n",
    "\n",
    "Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a class of models for the estimation of causal effects from observational data \\citet{Robins2000}. More specifically, marginal structural models allow us to make causal statements in the presence of time dependent confounding. Several key assumptions need to be met to achieve this. In this section we describe MSMs and focus on those assumtpions. This section explains the central concepts behind marginal structural models and introduces the notation that will be used in this thesis. Marginal structural models use only observed data and a set of assumptions to investigate causal effects. Positivity, the focus of this paper, is tied closely to confounder and, as we shall see, there is a trade-off between finer confounder control and positivity. The algorithm adapted in this paper simulates longitudinal data and hence we discuss time dependent confounding and the extra bits required for this. In particular, we draw attention to the core parts of MSMs needed for this study - linking to positivity.\n",

    "## Counterfactuals and causality\n",
    "\n",
    "In the counterfactual framework (\\citet{Neyman1923}, \\citet{Rubin1978}, \\citet{Robins1986}) the causal effect of treatment $X$ on outcome $Y$ for one subject can be defined as the difference between that subject's outcome had they been exposed and unexposed to X. In other words, one outcome is necessarily counterfactual because in reality the same subject cannot be both exposed and unexposed to $X$. If we denote the outcome when exposed as $Y_{x=1}$ and the outcome when not exposed as $Y_{x=0}$ then the causal effect for one subject can be expressed as $Y_{x=1} - Y_{x=0}$. For example, suppose a subject with a headache takes ibuprofen ($X = 1$), a popular treatment for headaches. After a suitable amount of time, say one hour, the headache either remains $Y_{x=1} = 1$ or has passed $Y_{x=1} = 0$. The outcome which is not observed is the counterfactual outcome that prevails had the subject, contrary to fact, not taken ibuprofen. In other words, we don't observe $Y_{x=0}$. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we are interested in the average causal effect for a population rather than for one subject. Suppose sixty subjects are suffering from a headache and every subject was given ibuprofen. After one hour each subject will either have a headache ($Y_{x=1}=1$) or their headache will have passed ($Y_{x=1}=0$). The average outcome across all subjects is $\\mathbb{E}(Y_{x = 1})$ or equivalently when $Y$ is a dichotomous variable, $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1})$. The relevant causal comparison is now between $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1})$ and $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0})$, the latter being the counterfactual had none of sixty subjects been exposed. We do not observe the quantity $Y_{x=0}$ for any subject, and consequently we do not observe the quantity $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0})$. \\linebreak\n",

    "\n",
    "Continuing the example, if group A consists of thirty of the headache sufferers who all took ibuprofen, we would ideally compare the quantity $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 1}|X = 1) = \\mu_{A_{x = 1}}$ with the quantity $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0}|X = 1) = \\mu_{A_{x = 0}}$. As $\\mu_{A_{x = 0}}$ is not actually observed, we could instead compute the observable quantity $\\mathbb{P}(Y_{x = 0}|X = 0) = \\mu_{B_{x=0}}$ from the remaining thirty subjects who did not use ibuprofen and belong to group B. Replacing the comparison between $\\mu_{A_{x = 1}}$ and $\\mu_{A_{x = 0}}$ with the comparison between $\\mu_{A_{x = 1}}$ and $\\mu_{B_{x=0}}$ will have a causal interpretation if $\\mu_{A_{x = 0}} = \\mu_{B_{x=0}}$. In other words, if a subject from group B can be viewed as an analogue of a subject from group A had they, contrary to fact, not received ibuprofen. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mu_{A_{x = 1}} \\neq \\mu_{B_{x=0}}$ then the comparison $\\mu_{A_{x = 1}} - \\mu_{B_{x=0}}$, a measure of association, is confounded for $\\mu_{A_{x = 1}} - \\mu_{A_{x = 0}}$, a measure of causal effect (\\citet{Greenland1999}). For example, if all the subjects in group A are male it would be reasonable to ask whether their sex influenced their decision to take ibuprofen. Suppose that males also tend to have headaches of a shorter duration so that at the end of one hour they are less likely to have a headache than females. The result is that both the decision to take ibuprofen and the probability of having a headache at the end of one hour are dependent on the sex of the subject. This obscures the causal effect of ibuprofen on headaches because there is a spurious association between $X$ and $Y$ through the subject's sex. We cannot establish whether the outcome is due to a causal relationship between ibuprofen and headache alleviation, a relationship between sex and headache alleviation or a mixture of the two.  \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to confounding, exchangeability is the assumption that the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes $Y_{x}$ is independent of the actually observed treatment $X$. When exchangeability holds, subjects from group A and group B are exchangeable in the sense that were they all to remain untreated the distribution of the counterfactual outcomes $Y_{x}$ would be the same in the two groups \\citet{Daniel2013}. Imagine exchanging a subject from group A with a subject from group B where both recieve the treatment prevailing in their new group. Under exchangeability, the average outcome in the two groups is unchanged \\citet{HernanMA2018}. However, exchanging subjects between group A and group B introduces females into group A and males into group B. As males have a higher probability that $Y = 0$, exchanging subjects changes the distribution of the counterfactuals. The relationship between confounding and exchangeability is why the assumption of exchangeability is also called the assumption of \"no unmeasured confounding\". \\linebreak\n",

    "## Directed Acyclic Graphs: graphical representations of causality\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal relationships, like those described in the previous section, can be represented using graphs. A graph consists of a finite set of vertices $\\nu$ and a set of edges $\\epsilon$. The vertices of a graph correspond to a collection of random variables which follow a joint probability distribution $P(\\nu)$. Edges in $\\epsilon$ consist of pairs of distinct vertices and denote a certain relationship that holds between the variables \\citet{Pearl2009}. The absence of an edge between two variables indicates that the variables are independent of one another. The direction of the causal relationship is denoted by an arrow and is acyclic because causal relationships between two variables only proceed in one direction. There are no feedback loops or mutual causation because in a causal framework a variable cannot be a cause of itself directly or indirectly \\citet{Hernan2004}.\\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, figure ? represents the case where interest is in the causal relationship between treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$. Treatment is assigned according to conditional distributions $P(treatment|male)$ and $P(treatment|female)$. Once treatment has been assigned, the outcome $Y$ is determined by both $X$ and $Z$ by the conditional distribution P(Y|X, Z). \\citet(Pearl2001}, \\citet(Pearl2014}. Blocking or screening off $Z$ has the same inuition as explained in the section on confounding. The causal effect of X and Y cannot be different between two subjects because of $Z$ when everyone is that strata has the same value of $Z$. Blocking is the same as holding $Z$ constant. Intuition to drive forward is that difference in outcome cannot be due to strata when everyone shares that strata.\n",

    "## Time dependent confounding\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have considered the time fixed context in which treatment and confounders take on a single value. It was sufficient to block the \"back door\" path between the treatment and outcome by conditioning on the confounding variable(s). In the headache example, the causal effect of ibuprofen on headache alleviation was confounded by sex. For most people, sex is a time-fixed covariate because it does not change value over time. To broaden the setting to a time dependent context, we adopt the canonical example of the causal effect of Zidovudine (AZT) on mortality amongst human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects \\citet{Hernan2000}. In this example, subjects are measured at baseline $t = 0$ and at subsequent visits. In each visit the patient's CD4 lymphocyte count is measured and a treatment decision  made. Survival at the end of follow-up is a binary outcome equal to 1 if the patient has died and 0 otherwise. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "The time-fixed notation can be extended to include subject histories for time varying variables. Treatment and covariate histories up to visit $k$ are can be represented by an overhead bar. For example, $\\bar X_{k} = \\{X_{0}, \\hdots, X_{k}\\}$ represented the vector of treatment decisions while $\\bar Z_{k} = \\{Z_{0}, \\hdots, Z_{k}\\}$ represents the vector of measurements on the time dependent-confounder $Z$. Time-fixed covariates like sex, or covariates which change linearly over time like age are tyically recorded at baseline ($t = 0$) and we denote the collection of baseline covariates as $V_{0}$.  The outcome of interest at the end of follow-up is mortality $Y$ which is a binary variable taking the value $1$ if the patient is dead and $0$ otherwise. \\linebreak \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the time-fixed case, time-dependent confounders lead to spurious associations between $X$ and $Y$ through a \"back door\" path between $X$ and $Y$ through $L$. To estimate a causal effect it is necessary to block this path by conditioning on the confounding variables. Figure ? gives an example of this in the time dependent case for two periods ($t = 0, 1$). In the first period a treatment decision is made based on the measured confounder $Z_0$. In the second period ($t = 1$) a new treatment decision is made based on both $Z_0$ and $Z_1$. Conditioning on $\\bar Z$ under this DAG leads to a consistent estimate of the causal effect because doing so blocks all paths between $X_0$ and $X_1$ and $Y$ except the causal path of interest. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the time-dependent context also admits structures like the middle pane of figure ? with the addition of a causal relationship between $X_0$ and $Z_1$. It is now possible for current treatments to be a determinant of future confounders which are in turn determinants of future treatment \\citet{Robins2000a}. As a result the effect of $A_0$ on $Y$ is mediated through $L_1$ in the path $A_0 \\rightarrow L_1 \\rightarrow Y$. Blocking this path by conditioning on $Z$ also blocks some portion of the effect of $A_0$ on $Y$ and will lead to a biased estimate. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "A second danger in the time-dependent context arises when $Z$ is a common effect of treatment and an unmeasured variable $U$ which also influences the outcome $Y$. There is no direct association \n",
    "Figure ? shows the same two structures with the addition of a an unmeasured variable $U$ which influences $Z$ and $Y$. Conditioning on $Z$. Selection bias precludes unbiased estimation \\citet{Hernan2004}. There is a mediating relationship between $A$ and $Z$ in which case there is a spurious relationship between $A$ and $Y$ again? This is less inuitive and so examples are best according to \\citet{Cole2010}. We can say that Z is a common effect of A and U, once we condition on Z we create a dependence of A on U. U is a cause of Y and hence there is an association between A and Y. This association is present even when there is no direct causal path between A and Y. \\linebreak\n",

    "\n",
    "Conclusion, 1) clearly a different technique is required for analysis 2) the nature of time dependent case needs to be described fully enough to explain why we choose the simulation algorithm that we choose and any holes in it. In subsequent sections our choice of simulation algorithm will be motivated by the structure of time dependent confounding as well as the viability of introducing positivity violations which are propogated through the time dependent structure.

    "Inverse probability of treatment weighting is a technique that can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of the causal effect of treatment on outcome in the presence of time dependent confounding. The intuition behind the technique is that by re-weighting the data a pseudopopulation is created in which the treatment is independent of any measured confounders. Regression analysis on the pseudopopulation can be carried out without the need to control for confounders eliminating the problems which arose in the previous section due to conditioning on $Z$. Crucially, in the pseudopopulation, the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ remains unchanged. As a result, it is possible to estimate the true causal effect of $X$ on $Y$.\n",

    "### Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "The consistency assumption states that the actual outcome is equal to the potential outcome under the treatment assignment which is actually taken. Every subject has a set of potential outcomes associated with the possible treatment or treatment history they can receive. Only one of these potential outcomes is factual and what the consistency assumption tells us is that factual outcome is equal to the potential outcome corresponding to the factual treatment. As a result we can write the following. \n",

    "$$P(Y_x = y\\ |\\ Z = z, X = x) = P(Y = y\\ |\\ Z = z, X = x)$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Several authors have discussed whether the consistency assumption is really an assumption or if it is a definition or axiom. The interested reader is referred to \\citet{VanderWeele2009}, \\citet{Cole2009} and \\citet{Pearl2010}.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No model mispecification\n",
    "\n",
    "Two models are estimated in marginal structural models. The structural model itself and the weight model. In both cases correct model specification is necessary to achieve consistent results. Typically the time the \"no model mispecification\" assumption refers to the weight model. Within a simulation context we can study the performance of the IPTW model in the complete absence of model mispecification because we specify the model.\n",

    "### No measurement error\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final assumption underlying MSMs, and the central topic of this thesis, is the positivity assumption. MSMs are used to estimate average causal effects in the study population, and one must therefore be able to estimate the average causal effect in every subset of the population defined by the confounders \\citet{Cole2008}. The positivity assumption requires that there be exposed and unexposed individuals in every strata of the confounding covariates. For example, when treatment is Zidovudine and CD4 count is the confounder, there must be a positive probability of some patients being exposed and unexposed at every level of CD4 count. Positivity can be expressed formally as $Pr(A=a\\ |\\ L) > 0$ for all $a \\in A$, which extends straightforwardly to the time dependent case where the positivity assumption must hold at every time step conditonal on previous treatment, time dependent confounders and any baseline covaraiates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Pr(A_{it}=a_{it}\\ |\\ L_{it}, A_{i, t-1}, V_{i0}) > 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Models for the risk $P(Y=1\\ |\\ A=a, L=l)$ are commonly studied in epidemiological applications. Applying basic probability rules reveals that the risk can be re-written with the term $Pr(A=a\\ |\\ L=l)$ in the denominator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y=1\\ |\\ A=a, L=l) = \\frac{P(Y=1, A=a, L=l)}{Pr(A=a, L=l)} = \\frac{P(Y=1, A=a, L=l)}{Pr(A=a\\ |\\ L=l)Pr(L=l)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is only estimable when $Pr(A=a\\ |\\ L=l) \\neq 0$. Therefore, when positivity does not hold it is not possible to estimate the model. In the context of MSMs a similar problem emerges. Although weighting via IPTW allows naive estimation of (?) without including the confounders, the weights in (?) involved the term $Pr(A=a\\ |\\ L=l)$ in the denominator. This means that the weights are inestimable whenever positivity is violated. In order to estimate the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$, weights must be estimable in every subset of the population otherwise the average causal effect in the study population cannot be estimated. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, positivity can arise when random zeroes or structural zeroes are present in some levels of the confounding covariates. Random zeroes arise when, by chance, no individuals or all individuals, receive treatment within a certain strata as defined by the covariates. For example, \\citet{Cole2008} studies positivity violations in individuals in strata defined by CD4 count and viral load. By increasing the levels of CD4 count the chances of random zeroes also increases and \\citet{Cole2008} show that the IPT weights rapidly lose their stability with the consequence that causal effects are no longer estimable. Researchers applying IPTW methods must actively check that there are both treated and untreated individuals at every level of their covariates within cells defined by their covariates because parametric methods will smooth over positivity violations and not provide any indication of nonpositivity. Increasingly refined covariates are attractive because they provide better control of confounding, but the point that \\citet{Cole2008} make is that this control needs to be traded off against increased occurence of random zeroes and subsequent instability of IPT weights. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "More relevant to this thesis are violations of the positivity assumption due to structural zeroes. These occur when an individual cannot possibly be treated or if an individual is always treated within some levels of the confounding covariate, as is the case in the clinical protocol example motivating this thesis. Several studies give examples of structural violations of the positivity assumption in epidemiological contexts. In \\citet{Cole2008} structural zeroes arise  when the health effects due to exposure to a chemical are confounded by health status proxied by being at work. If individuals can only be exposed to the chemical at work then all individuals not at work will be unexposed. A second example is liver disease as a contraindication of treatment. If individuals with liver disease cannot be treated then all individuals in the \"liver disease = 1\" strata will be untreated. In \\citet{Messer2010} structural zeroes arise in the context of rates of preterm birth and racial segregation, whereas \\citet{Cheng2010} find structural zeroes in the context of fetal position and perinatal outcomes. Our motivating example is most closely related to liver disease as a contraindication, except that the clinical protocols require that patients with low CD4 count always be treated instead of never being treated, as in the case in the liver disease example. \\linebreak\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in many epidemiological settings the positivity assumption is guaranteed by experimental design, studying positivity violations is relevant because, as our own motivating example and the examples above suggest, structural violations do occur, and random zeroes are always possible especially at finer levels of confounding covariates. Studying the finite sample propoerties of MSMs under violations to positivity is therefore an important issue which is yet to be dealt with systematically in the literature. As \\citet{Westreich2010} points out, positivity violations, positivity violations by a time varying confounder pose an analytic challenge and they suggest g-estimation or g-computation may be a way forward. A good start to dealing with the time varying confounder case is to see how well MSMs work when positivity is violated. This is also a novelty of this thesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. estimated weights with a mean far from one, or very extreme values indicate either non-positivity or model mispecification of the weight model.\n",
    "7. It is not always true that we want more finely tuned covariates for confounder control because the bias and variance of the effect estimate may increase with the number of categories. This is similar to the positivity masking example.\n",
    "11. Our results are equally valid for other circumstances in which positivity may arise.\n",
    "12. Also think about how the number of categories of exposure increases the chance that one level of exposure will have a positivity.\n",
    "13. Westreich and Cole 2010 have suggested that methodological approaches are needed to weigh the resultant biases incurred when trading of confounding and positivity. The framework we use is flexible enough to allow this in a simulation setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the structural bias occurs within levels of a time-dependent confounder then restriction or censoring may lead to bias whether one uses weighting or other methods (Cole and Hernan 2008). In fact, weighted estimates are more sensitive to random zeroes (Cole, Hernan, 2008)\n",
    "Introducing violations of positivity can be achieved by censoring observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to give an intuitive example, think about how it links back to a situation where sicker patients receive treatment compared to others. So in the \"sick\" strata of the CD4 count **ALL** patients receive treatment which inflates the IPTW. This also affects how we think about the associational versus causal models. The causal effect might be 50/50 but because sicker patients get treatment the mortality ratio in the treated group is likely to be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off between positivity and confounding bias is emphasized in Cole2008\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is practicality important? Cole paper highlights practical advice to practictioners. positivity can be violated in a practical setting because of two few strata, it can be the result of protocols in a clinical setting and it can be seen as a trade-off between exchangeability (and we need more measured predictors to maintain exchangeability) and positivity where more predictors leads to more likely a zero problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic stratgies evaluated using MSMs will have rules like, start treatment if CD4 falls below a certain threshold. See Didelez presentation on this\n",
    "- Explain that there is positivity in estimation of the structural model and also in the weight model. The reason why positivity is more important in the weight model is because when the weights are unstable the estimates can be very wrong as a result.\n"

In this chapter we start by describing the logic behin monte carlo simulations in general terms. Next, we consider several important criteria that a simulation model must exhibit in the context of MSMs. In particular we require an algorithm that can simulate from a specific MSM, has the observational structure described earlier and we also define noncollapsibility. Several algorithms have been proposed in the literature and these are briefly discussed and compared. We then focus on the algorithm suggested in \\citet{Havercroft2010} and explain why it satisfies our requirements. The most salient aspects of this algorithm for the purposes of this thesis are described. \n",

In order to simulating from a specific MSM we need to generate observational data in such a way that it conforms to a specific MSM. For instance, one specific MSM could be written as $P(Y\\ |\\ do(a)) = \\alpha + \\beta a$.

This method relies on four assumptions consistency, exchangeability, positivity and no mispecification of the model used to estimate the weights \\citet{Cole2008}. Unstabilized weights are defined as:\n",

    "$$w_{t,i} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{\\tau=0} ^ t p_{\\tau} (A_{\\tau, i}\\ |\\ \\bar A_{\\tau-1, i}, \\bar L_{\\tau, i})}$$ \n",

    "Where the denominator is the probability that the subject received the particular treatment history that they were observed to receive up to time $t$, given their prior observed treatment and covariate histories (Havercroft, Didelez, 2012). The probabilities $p_{\\tau} (A_{\\tau, i}\\ |\\ \\bar A_{\\tau-1, i}, \\bar L_{\\tau, i})$ may vary greatly between subjects when the covariate history is strongly asscoaited with treatment. In terms of the resulting pseudopopulation, very small values of the unstabilized weights for some subjects would result in a small number of observations dominating the weighted analysis. The result is that the IPTW estimator of the coefficients will have a large variance, and will fail to be normally distributed. This variability can be mitigated by using the following stabilized weights \n",

    "$$sw_{it} = \\frac{\\prod_{\\tau=0} ^ t p_{\\tau} (A_{\\tau, i}\\ |\\ \\bar A_{\\tau-1, i})} {\\prod_{\\tau=0} ^ t p_{\\tau} (A_{\\tau, i}\\ |\\ \\bar A_{\\tau-1, i}, \\bar L_{\\tau, i})}$$ \n",

In the case of confounding this will not be the case and the stabilized weight will vary around 1. \n",

    "In practice, we estimate the weights from the data using a pooled logistic model for the numerator and denominator probabilities. The histories of the treatment and covariates are included in the probabilities. In practice Specifically, following Havercroft and Didelez (2012), we estimate the model where the visit is only the visits every check up time. Between check ups both the treatment and covariate remain the same. Other ways of doing this include a spline function over the months to create a smooth function between the visits. Another difference might be to use a coxph function instead of logistic function\n",
